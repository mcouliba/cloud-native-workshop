== Microservices with Spring Boot

_45 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about Spring Boot and how you can build microservices 
using Spring Boot and JBoss technologies. During this lab, you will create a REST API for 
the Catalog service in order to provide a list of products for the CoolStore online shop.

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based 
applications with embedded web containers such as Tomcat (or JBoss Web Server), Jetty and Undertow 
that you can run directly on the JVM using **java -jar**. Spring Boot also allows producing a war 
file that can be deployed on stand-alone web containers.

The opinionated approach means many choices about Spring platform and third-party libraries 
are already made by Spring Boot so that you can get started with minimum effort and configuration.

=== Spring Boot Maven Project 

The **catalog-spring-boot** project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the Spring Boot project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

image:{% image_path springboot-catalog-project.png %}[Catalog Project,300]

This is a minimal Spring Boot project with support for RESTful services and Spring Data with JPA for connecting
to a database. This project currently contains no code other than the main class, ***CatalogApplication***
which is there to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

`*Examine 'com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog.CatalogApplication' class*` in the **/projects/workshop/labs/catalog-spring-boot/src/main** directory:

[source,java]
.CatalogApplication.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class CatalogApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CatalogApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

The database is configured using the Spring application configuration file which is located at 
**/projects/workshop/labs/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/resources/application.properties**. Examine this file to see the database connection details 
and note that an in-memory H2 database is used in this lab for local development and will be replaced
with a PostgreSQL database in the following labs. Be patient! More on that later.

You can use Maven to make sure the skeleton project builds successfully. You should get a **BUILD SUCCESS** message 
in the build logs, otherwise the build has failed.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Catalog - Build'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-catalog-build.png %}[Che - Catalog Build, 500]

Once successfully built, the resulting **catalog-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar** is located in the **/projects/workshop/labs/catalog-spring-boot/target/** directory.
This is an uber-jar with all the dependencies required packaged in the **jar** to enable running the application with **java -jar**.

Now that the project is ready, let's get coding and create a domain model, data repository, and a  
RESTful endpoint to create the Catalog service:

'''

=== Create the Domain Model

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*create the '/projects/workshop/labs/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/catalog/Product.java' file`* 

[source,java]
.Product.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import java.io.Serializable;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

@Entity // <1>
@Table(name = "PRODUCT") // <2>
public class Product implements Serializable {
  
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  @Id // <3>
  private String itemId;
  
  private String name;
  
  private String description;
  
  private double price;

  public Product() {
  }
  
  public String getItemId() {
    return itemId;
  }

  public void setItemId(String itemId) {
    this.itemId = itemId;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getDescription() {
    return description;
  }

  public void setDescription(String description) {
    this.description = description;
  }

  public double getPrice() {
    return price;
  }

  public void setPrice(double price) {
    this.price = price;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Product [itemId=" + itemId + ", name=" + name + ", price=" + price + "]";
  }
}
----
<1> **@Entity** marks the class as a JPA entity
<2> **@Table** customizes the table creation process by defining a table name and database constraint
<3> **@Id** marks the primary key for the table

'''

=== Create a Data Repository

Spring Data repository abstraction simplifies dealing with data models in Spring applications by 
reducing the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various 
persistence stores. https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.core-concepts[Repository and its sub-interfaces^] 
are the central concept in Spring Data which is a marker interface to provide 
data manipulation functionality for the entity class that is being managed. When the application starts, 
Spring finds all interfaces marked as repositories and for each interface found, the infrastructure 
configures the required persistent technologies and provides an implementation for the repository interface.

Create a new Java interface named **ProductRepository** in **com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog** package 
and extend https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html[CrudRepository^] interface in order to indicate to Spring that you want to expose a complete set of methods to manipulate the entity.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], 
`*create the '/projects/workshop/labs/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/catalog/ProductRepository.java' file`*.

[source,java]
.ProductRepository.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface ProductRepository extends CrudRepository<Product, String> { // <1>
}
----
<1> https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html[CrudRepository^] interface 
in order to indicate to Spring that you want to expose a complete set of methods to manipulate the entity

That's it! Now that you have a domain model and a repository to retrieve the domain model, 
let's create a RESTful service that returns the list of products.

'''

=== Create a RESTful Service

Spring Boot uses Spring Web MVC as the default RESTful stack in Spring applications. Create 
a new Java class named **CatalogController** in **com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog** package.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], 
`*create the '/projects/workshop/labs/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/catalog/CatalogController.java' file`*.

[source,java]
.CatalogController.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Spliterator;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.StreamSupport;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping(value = "/api/catalog")  // <1>
public class CatalogController {
    @Autowired   // <2>
    private ProductRepository repository; // <3>

    @ResponseBody
    @GetMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public List<Product> getAll() {
        Spliterator<Product> products = repository.findAll().spliterator();
        return StreamSupport.stream(products, false).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
----
<1> **@RequestMapping** indicates the above REST service defines an endpoint that is accessible via **HTTP GET** at **/api/catalog**
<2> Spring Boot automatically provides an implementation for **ProductRepository** at runtime and injects it into the 
controller using the 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection.html[**@Autowire**^] annotation.
<3> the **repository** attribute on the controller class is used to retrieve the list of products from the databases. 

Now, let's build and package the **Catalog Service** using Maven.
`*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Catalog - Build'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-catalog-build.png %}[Che - Catalog Build, 500]

Once done, you can conviently run your service using **Spring Boot maven plugin** and test the endpoint. 
`*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Catalog - Run'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-catalog-run.png %}[Che - Catalog Run, 500]

When you see **Started CatalogApplication** in the logs, you can access the 
Catalog REST API.

`*Click on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'User Runtimes' -> 'maven' -> 'localhost-9000'*`.

image:{% image_path che-localhost.png %}[Che - Localhost, 500]

Your browser will be redirect on **your Catalog Service running inside your Workspace**.

image:{% image_path catalog-service.png %}[Catalog Service,500]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
[{"itemId":"329299","name":"Red Fedora","desc":"Official Red Hat Fedora","price":34.99},...]
----

The REST API returned a JSON object representing the product list. Congratulations!

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], stop the service by `*hitting Ctrl+c in the '>_ Catalog - Run' Terminal*`

'''

=== Deploy on OpenShift

It’s time to build and deploy your service on OpenShift. 

As you did previously, `*create a new Component, a New URL then Push it in to the OpenShift cluster*`
by using the following inputs:

.OpenShift New Component
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|In which Application you want to create a Component
|coolstore

|Select source type for Component
|Binary File

|Select context folder
|$(plus) Add new context folder.

|Open
|/projects/workshop/labs/catalog-spring-boot

|Select binary file
|$(file-zip) catalog-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

|Provide Component name
|catalog

|Component type
|java

|Component type version
|11

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to push your component first in order to create a Route for it.
====

.OpenShift New URL
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|Provide URL name
|catalog

|Select port to expose
|8080/tcp

|===

Once this completes, your application should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of 
the application in one or more pods which are the unit of runtime deployment and consists of the running 
containers for the project. 

'''

=== Test your Service

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Catalog Service*`

image:{% image_path openshift-catalog-topology.png %}[OpenShift - Catalog Topology, 700]

Your browser will be redirect on **your Catalog Service running on OpenShift**.

image:{% image_path catalog-service.png %}[Catalog Service,500]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
[{"itemId":"329299","name":"Red Fedora","desc":"Official Red Hat Fedora","price":34.99},...]
----

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
